# 1. Progress Made
Finished skeleton for all the code.

# 2. Problems and Potential Concerns
Still waiting on hardware to arrive. Worried that my motor will not be able to successfully spin the food wheel.

# 3. Priorities for the next week
Finish up the contraption and incorporate it fully into the UI. Then I should be done!
