# 1. Progress Made
I've finished up the UI set up the navigation of all the pages for the website.

# 2. Problems and Potential Concerns
I'm worried about building the actual contraption. I'm not sure if I'll be able to find the correct parts that fit together. And if the contraption will actually work (if the food wheel will be able to dispense food properly).

# 3. Priorities for the next week
Have a prototype of the contraption set up. Have hardware capabilities created.
