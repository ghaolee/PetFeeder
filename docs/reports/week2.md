# 1. Progress Made
Incorporated PhoneGap Desktop to my UI so that I can use it live and on mobile. Waiting on hardware to arrive.

# 2. Problems and Potential Concerns
Hardware hasn't all arrived. I'm worried that I will not have enough time to test and change my parts if necessary. 

# 3. Priorities for the next week
Finish up the contraption and incorporate it fully into the UI. Then I should be done!
